ðŸ§© Other Logic-Based Projects & Experience:
Implemented a custom BigDecimal data type for high-precision arithmetic operations
Built logic-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe (XO), Pyramid XO, and Connect Four
Solved over 200+ algorithmic problems across platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and others
Developed various other mini-projects independently and through university coursework

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Language: C++

ðŸš€ Challenges & Learnings:
Through building projects and solving 200+ coding problems, I significantly improved my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. Working in C++ taught me efficient memory management, performance optimization, and how to write modular, testable logic. These experiences helped me transition from basic solutions to optimized ones, deepening my understanding of complexity analysis and real-world software design.
